# iamnotadoctor App API Reference

**Local setup:** preferred base URL is `https://iamnotadoctor.localhost` when Portless is running, otherwise `http://localhost:3000`. No authentication.

```bash
BASE_URL="$(portless get iamnotadoctor 2>/dev/null || printf http://localhost:3000)"
AUTH=()
```

**Hosted setup:** the rider's own domain. Every request needs the access token; without it the app answers 401.

```bash
BASE_URL="https://kickr.example.com"
AUTH=(-H "Authorization: Bearer $APP_AUTH_TOKEN")
```

The same operations, plus trainer control and ride statistics, are available as MCP tools at `$BASE_URL/api/mcp`. Prefer MCP when your runtime supports it.

## Current Agent Contract

The iamnotadoctor app handles live coaching, workout building, ride summaries, and Bluetooth internally. Over HTTP, agents focus on personal fitness tracking after rides.

Use these endpoints:

```txt
GET /api/rider
PUT /api/rider
PATCH /api/rider/memory
GET /api/sessions
GET /api/sessions?includeSamples=true
GET /api/sessions/:id
GET /api/monthly-summaries
```

Trainer control is only available through the MCP trainer tools, and only when the rider asks.

## First Smoke Test

```bash
curl -sf "${AUTH[@]}" "$BASE_URL/api/rider"
curl -sf "${AUTH[@]}" "$BASE_URL/api/sessions"
```

## Rider Context

```txt
GET /api/rider
PUT /api/rider
PATCH /api/rider/memory
```

`GET /api/rider` returns:

```ts
type RiderProfile = {
  fourDP: { nm: number; ac: number; map: number; ftp: number };
  cTHR: number;
  age: number | null;
  weightKg: number | null;
  gender: "male" | "female" | string | null;
  hrZones: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    percentageRange: string;
    minBpm: number;
    maxBpm: number;
    color: string;
  }[];
  colors: { nm: string; ac: string; map: string; ftp: string };
  memorySummary: string;
};
```

On first install, ask the rider for age, broad fitness level, cycling background, goals, and constraints. Store:

- numeric age in `age`
- explicitly provided weight, gender, cTHR, and 4DP values in their matching fields
- qualitative fitness level, goals, constraints, and tracking preferences in `memorySummary`

`PUT /api/rider` accepts partial profile patches and merges them into the current profile, then validates the result. Use it only for rider-approved changes to profile fields such as age, weight, cTHR, 4DP, HR zones, or colors.

For memory-only updates, prefer:

```txt
PATCH /api/rider/memory
```

Payload:

```json
{ "memorySummary": "Short rider-facing memory..." }
```

## Sessions

```txt
GET /api/sessions
GET /api/sessions/:id
```

`GET /api/sessions` returns saved ride summaries, usually newest-first. It does not include raw samples:

```ts
type RideSessionSummary = {
  id: string;
  workoutName: string;
  timestamp: number;
  sampleCount: number;
  metrics: {
    tss: number;
    iff: number;
    durationSeconds: number;
    avgPower?: number;
    avgHr?: number;
    avgCadence?: number;
  };
  riderComments?: string;
  llmSummaryStatus?: "skipped" | "generated" | "failed";
  llmSummary?: {
    headline: string;
    summary: string;
    keyObservations: string[];
    heartRateZoneAssessment: string;
    riderCommentsReflection?: string;
    trainingLoadAssessment: string;
    dataQualityNotes: string[];
    suggestedNextFocus: string[];
    memoryCandidate: string;
  };
  llmSummaryError?: string;
};
```

Use `GET /api/sessions/:id` when raw samples are needed for a specific ride. The app can also call `GET /api/sessions?includeSamples=true` to retrieve all sessions with samples for its own history UI.

Use `llmSummary` as the primary narrative source for personal tracking. If a summary is skipped or failed, summarize from metrics and rider comments conservatively.

## Monthly Summaries

```txt
GET /api/monthly-summaries
```

Use monthly summaries when available for trend-level exports or memory updates. If unavailable or empty, fall back to recent sessions.

## Memory Update Pattern

1. Read `/api/rider`.
2. Read recent `/api/sessions`.
3. Build a short proposed `memorySummary` from stable patterns and the app's `llmSummary.memoryCandidate` fields.
4. Ask the rider before writing it.
5. `PATCH /api/rider/memory` with the approved `memorySummary`.

Avoid medical claims. Do not change FTP, cTHR, or HR zones based on one ride.
